### Who am I?

Hi, I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I live in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. However, I'm not interested in video game development. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it at A1 level. And in programming world, I only know Python. I'm trying to learn C and C++, however, I like how capable Python is on AI (Artificial Intelligence). I definitely want to be a software developer in the future and work on AI things or maybe quantum computers.
