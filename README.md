### Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it. And in programming world, the languages I know follow as:
- Python
- C++ (pre-intermediate)
- C# (beginner)
- Java (beginner)

I've been learning Python since 2017 (it's been 5 years, wow) and I decided to jump to other languages in late 2021, starting with C#, followed by C++ and Java. I was first interested in object oriented programming, yet I've been into low level and procedural programming nowadays. And, well, I definitely want to be a software engineer.

I'm currently watching some C++ courses on YouTube to learn the language and gain a full understanding of algorithms, data structures and all that.
