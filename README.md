### Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it at A1 level. And in programming world, the languages I know follow as:
- Python (at a very high level)
- C# (pre-intermediate)
- C++ (beginnner)

As can be seen in the above list, I only know Python at a decent level. I'm trying to learn C# and C++, however, I like how capabilities of Python is way more than them. Furthermore, in my opinion, code written in Python is way easier to read and understand compared to others. Only disadvantage of Python, in my opinion, is that it's an interpreted language which makes compiling a piece of code written in it to an .exe file impossible (nonetheless, you still can compile it to byte code). To recapitulate, I definitely want to be a software developer in the future.

I'm currently working one project named [Encrypt-n-Decrypt](https://github.com/Yilmaz4/Encrypt-n-Decrypt). I learn new things about computers 'n programming everyday from sources such as StackOverflow or YouTube, and as I learn new things about Python, I implement them in my projects. My goal while trying to achieve something has always been writing as few lines as possible. Although I usually don't care about optimization except in particular cases, I prefer to use the simplest way which actually makes the code optimized.

I'm planning to work in a small company or even my own company as a desktop software developer or back-end web developer.
