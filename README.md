### Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it. And in programming world, the languages I know follow as:
- Python (at a decent level)
- C++ (pre-intermediate)
- C# (pre-intermediate)
- Java (beginner)

I've been learning Python since 2017 (it's been 5 years, wow) and I decided to jump to other languages in late 2021, starting with C#, followed by C++ and Java. I hate C though, for some reason. It's too low-level. Anyway, I like creating desktop applications for Windows, however, I recently started learning web development as well. If I become a web developer though, I would definitely be a back-end developer, I literally suck at design. Anyways, to recapitulate, I definitely want to be a software developer in the future.

I'm currently working on a project named [Encrypt-n-Decrypt](https://github.com/Yilmaz4/Encrypt-n-Decrypt) which I'd started 2 years ago. I rewrote and started over lots of times, though, that's why it took very long. I learn new things about computers 'n programming everyday from sources such as StackOverflow or YouTube, and as I learn new things about Python, I implement them in my projects. My goal while trying to achieve something has always been writing as few lines as possible (and to make the code as complicated as possible, idk why lol). Although I usually don't care about optimization except in particular cases, I prefer to use the way with least lines possible which actually makes the code optimized.

I'm planning to work in a small company or even my own company as a desktop software developer or back-end web developer as I said above.
