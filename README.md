### Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it at A1 level. And in programming world, I only know Python. I'm trying to learn C, C# and C++, however, I like how capable Python is on AI (Artificial Intelligence). Furthermore, in my opinion, code written in Python is way easier to read compared to C or Java. Only disadvantage of Python in my opinion is that it's an interpreted language which makes compiling code written in it to an .exe file impossible. I definitely want to be a software developer in the future and work on AI.

I'm currently working on two projects, [perspective.py](https://github.com/Yilmaz4/perspective.py) and [Encrypt-n-Decrypt](https://github.com/Yilmaz4/Encrypt-n-Decrypt). I learn new things about computers 'n programming everyday from sources such as StackOverflow or YouTube, and as I learn new things about Python, I implement them in my projects. My goal while trying to achieve something has always been writing as few lines as possible. Although I usually don't care about optimization except in particular cases, I prefer to use the simplest way which actually makes the code optimized.

I'm planning to work in a small company or even my own company as a desktop software developer or back-end web developer.
