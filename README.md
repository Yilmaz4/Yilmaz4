### Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm YÄ±lmaz. I'm 15 years old and I'm living in Istanbul, Turkey. I'm currently studying in TED Ronesans highschool, in prep class. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and tennis. I can speak Turkish, English and a little bit German since I'm still learning it at A1 level. And in programming world, I only know Python. I'm trying to learn C and C++, however, I like how capable Python is on AI (Artificial Intelligence). I definitely want to be a software developer in the future and work on AI. Furthermore, code written in Python is way easier to read compared to C or Java. Only disadvantage of Python in my opinion is that it's an interpreted language which makes compiling code written in it to an .exe file impossible.
